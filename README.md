# Cub3d

School Project 42: (in a group)

3D graphics project using Raycasting (this is a rendering technique which, from a 2D map, will display
in real time an environment which has the appearance of a rudimentary 3D).
The goal of the project is therefore to display walls correctly and to be able to move around on the map (W, A, S, D). Possibility of rotating the camera (right and left arrows)
Use of the graphics lib provided by 42: MiniLibx.

## For launch
